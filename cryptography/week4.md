1. Question 1
True or false: CBC-mode encryption with PKCS #5 padding provides message integrity, as long as the receiver makes sure to verify the padding upon decryption.
  - True
  - **False**
2. Question 2
Let FF be a block cipher with nn-bit block length. Consider the message authentication code for 2n2n-bit messages defined by {\sf Mac}_k(m_1, m_2) = F_k(m_1 \oplus m_2)Mac 
k(m 1	,m 2)=F k(m 1⊕m 2). Which of the following gives a valid attack on this scheme?

  - **Obtain tag tt on message m_1, m_2m 1 ,m 2  (with m_1 \neq m_2m 1 =m 2 ), and then output the tag tt on the message m_2, m_1m 2 ,m 1	 .**
